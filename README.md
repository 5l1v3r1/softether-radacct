 SoftEther RADIUS accounting PHP script
 
So I thought I'm not going to wait for others to finally create an accounting mod for SoftEther, and dnobori have no reason to further extend his work. This script is something I wrote in a weekend so I could integrate SoftEther into other parts of my system that already fully use RADIUS.
